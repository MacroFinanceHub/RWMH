## DSGE Model Estimation using RWMH algorithm

### PS3 - problem 1

Bayesian estimation of the small-scale DSGE model in Chapters 4.1. and 4.2 of *Herbst and Schorfheide (2015)*.  

Two experiments: 

- **Robustness of the empirical results**: change the sample. 
- **Performance of the algorithm**: change the proposal distribution.
